# Ideas

* Save/Load. 

* Options Page
  * syntax themes here - [Styles](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles)
  * Link Shortening.
  * Save frequency.
  * Fixed popup Size.
  * Themes.
  * Set language (others wouldn't highlight properly unless the prefix before the backticks overrides).
  * Shortcut keys (Can probably control them through code. Haven't checked.)
  * Live update of tab on or off.
  * Local / Sync save option. (All local currently)

* ~~Text input commands.~~ Now handles tabs and alt-up/down to switch lines
* Different contexts (for multiple tabs).
* Could look into pulling the popup out into a half window and pretend its docked.
* ~~Add title attribute to links in markdown if possible so output would reference long links in meantime while options are made.~~ DONE. Make option?

### Issues?
1. The save of everything is happening roughly ~~60~~ 30 times a second atm. That might cause problems eventually so could be rethought (Although makes the live update nice and easy)

1. ~~API key should be moved out of main files~~ - Might not really matter. Packaged with extension regardless

1. The 'Save' button on options.js causes page to flicker / refresh. How to stop that and keep the validation (built into HTML5)?

### Misc
 
1. Further styling of new tabs page possibly. Barebones atm
2. I looked into making it scroll with your position in the popup text box. Doesn't seem like something that is anything close to easy - Especially as they would be of different lengths

# Options
### Options.js 
* Load full objects object from storage. Put in variable
* Use options variable to set the state of the options. Tick or untick boxes etc. 
* When option changed
  * Update options variable with that info
  * Save whole options object to storage

### background.js
* getOptions function that returns the whole option object
``` js
// Use like

let options = await getOptions(); // Got them all

// The option I'm interested in exists. 
// Can be used as boolean in this case
// Assigned to variable if needed
if (options.shortUrl) { 
  url = await getShortBitUrl(url, bitUrlToken)
} 

// Stupid example
if (options.backgroundColour) { // Exists
  let backgroundColour = options.backgroundColour;
  doStuffWithIt();
} else {
  doDefaultColour();
}
```
